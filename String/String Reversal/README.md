<h1>String Reversal</h1>
<br>
String reversal is a basic problem which can help us to understand the <b> fundamental of recursion.</b>

<h2>Q. Write a program which reverse the string recursively.</h2>

In the string reversal function, two elements are swapped such that : string[k] = string[(len(string)-1) - k].
<br>
For string "Srijan" the swap will be as followed: <br> <br>
  0th: Srijan <br>
  1st: <i>n</i>rija<i>S</i> <br>
  2nd: <i>na</i>ij<i>rS</i> <br>
  3rd: <i>najirS</i>  <br>
